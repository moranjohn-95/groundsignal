## 2. Project Aims

The main aim of SiteForecaster is to help electrical contractors find relevant local construction opportunities without having to manually search through large volumes of planning application data.

Planning data is publicly available, but it can be difficult and time-consuming to work through. SiteForecaster takes this information and presents it in a more useful way by allowing users to search by location, review nearby planning applications, and quickly identify projects that may involve electrical work.

The project aims to:

- make Irish planning data easier to search and understand.
- help electrical contractors find potential work opportunities in their area.
- rank opportunities using a clear and consistent scoring system.
- highlight planning applications where electrical work is confirmed, likely, possible, or not specifically identified.
- provide enough information for users to decide which opportunities are worth investigating further.
- keep planning data reasonably up to date through automated background syncing.
- provide a responsive and accessible interface that works across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

From a development point of view, the project was also built to demonstrate how a modern full-stack application can be designed, tested, deployed, and maintained in a production environment.

## 3. Problem Statement

Irish planning application data contains useful information about upcoming construction and development projects. For tradespeople such as electricians, this can provide an early indication of where future work may become available.

The problem is that the raw planning data is not designed specifically for contractors looking for work. A large number of applications may need to be reviewed before finding one that is relevant, and important details can be spread across descriptions, development types, locations, and other fields.

For a small electrical contractor, manually searching this information regularly would take time and still make it easy to miss useful opportunities.

SiteForecaster addresses this by processing planning applications and presenting them through a contractor-focused interface. Applications can be searched by location and are given an opportunity score based on factors such as project scope, scale, timing, category, and signs of electrical work.

The aim is not to guarantee that a planning application will become a paid job. Instead, SiteForecaster helps reduce the amount of planning data a contractor needs to review and gives them a more focused starting point for finding potential opportunities.

## 4. Target Audience

The current version of SiteForecaster is aimed primarily at electrical contractors and electricians working in Ireland.

This includes:

- self-employed electricians looking for new local work.
- small electrical contracting businesses that want to identify upcoming projects.
- contractors who want to spend less time manually searching planning records.
- businesses interested in finding residential, commercial, industrial, public, or mixed-use developments that may require electrical work.

The platform is particularly useful for smaller contractors who may not have dedicated sales or business-development staff but still want an organised way to identify potential work in their area.

SiteForecaster is currently focused on electricians, but the underlying planning-data and opportunity-scoring approach could later be adapted for other construction trades if there is a clear business case.

## 5. User Goals

SiteForecaster is designed to help users find relevant planning opportunities quickly and with less manual searching.

The main user goals are to:

- search for planning opportunities near a chosen location.
- quickly understand which applications are most relevant.
- identify projects that may involve electrical work.
- compare opportunities using a clear scoring system.
- review useful project details without opening every planning record individually.
- sort and filter results so the strongest opportunities can be reviewed first.
- open the original planning application when more detail is needed.
- use the platform easily across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

The overall goal is to reduce the time spent searching through planning data and help users focus their attention on the applications most likely to be worth investigating.

## 6. Product Value

The value of SiteForecaster is not that it creates new planning data. The value comes from making existing public planning information easier to use for a specific type of contractor.

Instead of treating every planning application equally, SiteForecaster adds an extra layer of analysis. Applications are scored and ranked based on factors such as project scale, timing, category, scope, and signs of electrical work.

This helps users:

- spend less time reviewing low-value or irrelevant applications.
- spot stronger opportunities earlier.
- understand why one project may be more relevant than another.
- work from a more focused list of potential leads.
- use public planning information in a way that is more practical for business development.

SiteForecaster is intended to support decision-making rather than replace it. A high-scoring opportunity is not a guaranteed job, and users are still expected to review the original planning application before taking any further action.

## 7. User Experience

The user experience was designed around one main idea: finding useful planning opportunities should be quick and easy to understand.

A user can enter a location, choose a search radius, and view nearby planning applications without needing to understand the structure of the underlying planning dataset. Results are presented as opportunity cards with the most useful information shown first.

The interface gives particular attention to:

- clear opportunity scores and labels.
- simple electrical-work indicators.
- readable project descriptions and addresses.
- sorting options that help users prioritise stronger opportunities.
- clear loading, empty, error, and retry states.
- responsive layouts across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- accessible headings, labels, focus states, and interactive controls.

The opportunity detail view provides more information when needed without overloading the main results page. Users can also follow the official planning application link if they want to verify the source information or investigate the project further.

The design avoids unnecessary complexity. The aim is to help a contractor understand the value of a planning application quickly, rather than forcing them to interpret technical planning data themselves.

## Production Nginx and privacy-safe logging

Nginx is the production reverse proxy and static frontend server on EC2. Its
version-controlled configuration is in `deploy/nginx/`. The custom
`siteforecaster_safe` access-log format records the request method and `$uri`
path, but intentionally excludes query strings and referrers. This minimises
retention of user-entered location searches and coordinates. Uvicorn access
logging is disabled separately; Nginx error logging remains available.

### Install or update the Nginx configuration

From `/home/ubuntu/groundsignal` after deploying this repository revision:

```bash
sudo install -D -m 0644 deploy/nginx/siteforecaster-safe-logging.conf \
  /etc/nginx/conf.d/siteforecaster-safe-logging.conf
sudo install -D -m 0644 deploy/nginx/siteforecaster.conf \
  /etc/nginx/sites-available/siteforecaster
sudo ln -sfn /etc/nginx/sites-available/siteforecaster \
  /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/siteforecaster

sudo nginx -t
# Reload only after nginx -t succeeds.
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

The live SSL certificate and private-key files referenced by this configuration
are managed separately. Never commit certificate or key material to this
repository.

## Production planning-data sync

Planning applications are stored locally in PostgreSQL. The initial full import
is a separate operation; ongoing production freshness uses inclusive rolling
`ReceivedDate` windows. Existing applications are updated and missing ones are
inserted by source object ID, so repeating a window is safe and idempotent.

- The recent, near-real-time sync runs every 15 minutes with a 7-day window.
- A 90-day reconciliation runs daily at 03:15 UTC.
- `ETL_DATE` is deliberately not used as an incremental watermark because the
  source batch-refreshes older records.

Both jobs run inside the existing Docker Compose `api` container and are
scheduled by systemd timers on the Ubuntu EC2 host. The 7-day timer has been
verified in production with a successful `status=0` run.

### Install the systemd timers

From `/home/ubuntu/groundsignal` after deploying this repository revision:

```bash
sudo cp deploy/systemd/siteforecaster-planning-sync.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp deploy/systemd/siteforecaster-planning-sync.timer /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp deploy/systemd/siteforecaster-planning-reconcile.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp deploy/systemd/siteforecaster-planning-reconcile.timer /etc/systemd/system/

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now siteforecaster-planning-sync.timer
sudo systemctl enable --now siteforecaster-planning-reconcile.timer
```

### Verify and operate

```bash
systemctl list-timers --all | grep siteforecaster
systemctl status siteforecaster-planning-sync.timer --no-pager
systemctl status siteforecaster-planning-reconcile.timer --no-pager
journalctl -u siteforecaster-planning-sync.service -n 50 --no-pager
journalctl -u siteforecaster-planning-reconcile.service -n 50 --no-pager
```

For a manual recent sync, the default window is 7 days:

```bash
docker compose exec -T api python -m backend.app.commands.planning_sync
docker compose exec -T api python -m backend.app.commands.planning_sync --days 90
```
